# Rigol-DP813A-Programmable-Linear-Dc-Power-Supply
Python scripts for programmatically controlling a Rigol DP813A DC power supply


You may need to insatll the Ultra Sigma drivers and software to locate the power supply on your network,
In my use case the power supply received an ip address via dhcp and I used the Ultra Sigma software and drivers. 
If you utilize my scripts please change the ip address in the script to properly align with the ip address of your power supply.

There's absolutely no warranty, You accept sole responsibility if utilizing any of the scripts in this repository

Drivers and software can be found on the official https://www.rigolna.com/products/dc-power-loads/dp800/ website
